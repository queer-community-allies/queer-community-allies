Our volunteer board of directors do the work! 
- We meet, discuss, plan, coordinate, and visit schools. 
- We currently have five board members with capacity for ten. 
- We vote on important decisions and maintain our bylaws. 
- Some of our board members hold an office (president, vice president, secretary, treasurer) and some don't. We trade off other assignments (website, social media, visiting schools, digital accounts, GSA advisor contact, paperwork, etc) based on who has availability and interest in the moment. We're very collaborative! 
- We meet at least every three months and often every month, hour tops. We also email and text each other. 
- We each spend two or three hours a month on QCA work. 
- All board members must be 18+ and able to pass a background check.
- As we're a locally-focused organization, board members should live and/or work in our area pocket, Utah County or south Salt Lake County.
