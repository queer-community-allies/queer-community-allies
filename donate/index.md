## Holiday Donation Drawing

From Monday Nov. 18 to Sun. Dec. 29, 2019, all individuals who donate $10 to Queer Community Allies will be entered into a holiday drawing; individuals may be entered as many times as they wish. ($100 = 10 entries!) The drawing will occur on December 30. All monetary donations from local businesses and from our holiday drawing will be put towards helping GSAs for the rest of the school year, funding ongoing projects, and planning summer community events! 

There are two ways to donate!

- [Donate via PayPal](/donate/paypal)
- [Donate via Venmo](/donate/venmo)
