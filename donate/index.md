## Volunteer board of directors 

- We do the work! Meet, discuss, plan, coordinate, & visit. 
- We serve 1-year terms, vote on important decisions and maintain our bylaws. 
- We currently have 5 board members with capacity for 10. 
- Some of our board members hold an office (president, vice president, secretary, treasurer). We trade off other assignments (website, social media, visiting schools, digital accounts, GSA advisor contact, paperwork, etc) based on who has availability and interest in the moment. We're very collaborative! 
- We meet at least every three months and often every month, hour tops. We also email and text each other. 
- We each spend two or three hours a month on QCA work. 
- All board members must be 18+ and able to pass a background check.
- As we're a locally-focused organization, board members should live and/or work in our area pocket, Utah County or south Salt Lake County.

## #AdoptaGSA 

A HUGE way you can help change our communities to be safer places is to support YOUR local high school GSA. A GSA (gay-straight alliance) is an extracurricular club supported by a high school teacher, counselor, or staff member and led by high school students. They get together regularly to socialize, play games, learn new skills, or do service projects. Call your local high school & ask them to put you in touch with their GSA advisor. Some information about local GSAs is included [on our GSA listing page](Ô∏èresources/gsas.html).

## From GLAAD: 10 Ways to Be an Ally & a Friend

- Be a listener.
- Be open-minded.
- Be willing to talk.
- Be inclusive.
- Don't assume that your friends and co-workers are straight. Someone close to you could be looking for support in their coming-out process. 
- Anti-LGBT comments and jokes are harmful. Vocalize that you find them offensive.
- Confront your own prejudices and bias, even if it is uncomfortable to do so.
- Defend your LGBT friends against discrimination.
- Believe that all people, regardless of gender identity and sexual orientation, should be treated with dignity and respect.
