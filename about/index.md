Welcome to Queer Community Allies! We are a unique 501(c)(3) organization that serves queer teens in collaboration with the local community. Nestled between Salt Lake City and Provo in north Utah County, we find groups for and led by queer teens and provide tangible and emotional support. We raise money to donate directly to and purchase supplies for their projects, clubs, and organizations. We partner with local businesses and allies. We use our connections and funds to provide social events, share resources to educate the local populace on queer terminology and queer life, and go to local community events to raise acceptance of our community's queer young people. We also share local resources through our website for queer teens and their families.  

We are often asked why start an organization at all, when Salt Lake City and Provo offer so many wonderful resources. That is exactly why we started - because for many families we've met, driving to SLC or Provo is unfeasible due to mileage, lack of public transport, and/or time. It is even more unfeasible for youth living in unaffirming homes. We wanted a mobile organization that could reach these teens and families from Eagle Mountain to Cedar Hills. 

We are also asked why we chose the word "Queer" for our name. Like many, we belong to a younger generation that has reclaimed the term and love it for encompassing evolving self-definition/self-exploration and as an umbrella term for not hetersexual-heteroromantic. Also, a lot of the teens we know use it, so it's a way to resonate with them. We know many people hate the word, associate it with slang or derision, and/or associate it with certain political positions or cultural backgrounds. There's definitely a broad range of approaches to the word. We love this article that shares many perspectives on the term Queer.

Our origins...

Queer Community Allies started in the spring of 2019 as a plan among friends in a social media group to support the local high school GSA (gay straight alliance). Reeling from news of more local queer teen deaths and more local queer bullying, Christine (she/her) and Sarah (she/her, they/their) were talking and trying to organize with their friends to donate time and money to the high school club. They wanted to show teens that they had support in the larger community and raise the level of acceptance in their predominantly anti-LGBTQIA+ cities. After some productive conversations, Christine and Sarah deciding to spend the next few weeks turning these ideas into the paperwork necessary to recognize Queer Community Allies as a non-profit corporation by the State of Utah.

Contact us if you want to get involved! We are currently a tiny organization with limited volunteer opportunities aside from joining the board to organize efforts. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, our service opportunities are even more limited. We welcome adults 18+ who could pass a background check and who are creative and willing to devote a few hours each month. We have existed for just over a year and to date have raised almost $3,000 in donations. 


> My goal for this organization is to create a safe space for all Queer teens within their own communities. I want to get local resources working together as a united front so that these kids can leave their homes knowing people care and will protect them. I also want to identify where additional resources are needed and provide them. My dream is to have a space where teens can come hang out, do homework, get therapy and just be kids. I want to create that space so that all teens can have normal childhood experiences. Weâ€™ll have a pool so trans kids can swim and be themselves SAFELY! That is my dream. ~Christine 

> My goal for the next few years is to build up a local network for and with local teens that helps them feel loved, involved, connected, and confident. Hopefully these efforts will, in turn, lower suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completions among all teen demographics in this area as well as alleviate queer teen dislocation, homelessness, and peer/family rejection. There is so much to be done, and I'm excited to WORK! ~Sarah
