Welcome to Queer Community Allies! We are a unique 501(c)(3) organization that serves queer teens in collaboration with the local community. Nestled between Salt Lake City and Provo in north Utah County, we find groups for and led by queer kids and provide tangible and emotional support, often inviting local businesses and local allies to be involved. We raise money to donate directly to various queer kids’ projects, clubs, and organizations and purchase supplies to give to these projects and clubs. We use our relationships, connections, and funds to provide social events, share resources to educate the local populace on queer terminology and queer life, and be present at local community events to raise awareness and acceptance of our community's queer young people. We also share local service opportunities and provide local resources through our website for queer kids and their families.  

We are often asked why we chose the word "Queer" for our name. Like many, we belong to a younger generation that has reclaimed the term and love it for encompassing evolving self-definition/self-exploration and as an umbrella term for not hetersexual-heteroromantic. Also, a lot of the teens we know use it, so it's a way to resonate with them. We know many people hate the word, associate it with slang or derision, and/or associate it with certain political positions or cultural backgrounds. There's definitely a broad range of approaches to the word, and we love this article that shares many perspectives on the term Queer.

Our origins...

Queer Community Allies started in the spring of 2019 as a plan among friends in a social media group to support the local high school GSA (gay straight alliance). Reeling from news of more local queer teen deaths and more local queer bullying, Christine Hubbard (she/her) and Sarah DeLong (she/her, they/their) wondered how they could rally their friends to donate time and money to the high school club. They wanted to show teens that they had support in the larger community and raise the level of acceptance in their predominantly anti-2LGBTQIA+ cities. After only a few conversations, Christine and Sarah knew these efforts were headed to something bigger, and over the next few weeks they turned these ideas into the paperwork necessary to recognize Queer Community Allies as a non-profit corporation by the State of Utah. Our kickoff social & fundraising event was held in the summer of 2019.

> My goal for this organization is to create a safe space for all Queer teens within their own communities. I want to get local resources working together as a united front so that these kids can leave their homes knowing people care and will protect them. I also want to identify where additional resources are needed and provide them. My dream is to have a space where teens can come hang out, do homework, get therapy and just be kids. I want to create that space so that all teens can have normal childhood experiences. We’ll have a pool so trans kids can swim and be themselves SAFELY! That is my dream. ~Christine 

> My goal for the next few years is to build up a local network for and with local teens that helps them feel loved, involved, connected, and confident. Hopefully these efforts will, in turn, lower suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completions among all teen demographics in this area as well as alleviate queer teen dislocation, homelessness, and peer/family rejection. There is so much to be done, and I'm excited to WORK! ~Sarah
