We've had a request from GSA teens for scrapbook and craft supplies! They would like to use them to create holiday cards to fundraise money for their club. If you have supplies you'd like to donate, YogaVega is our drop-off point! Swing by their studio anytime between October 9th and October 23rd on their open dates between 8AM & 12PM or 6PM & 9PM. They are giving each donor a free class pass! Ask at their front desk. They are located at 1306 N Redwood Rd Saratoga Springs. 

Join us for Fall Break Bowling on Friday October 18th 1pm-3pm @ Jack & Jill Lanes Lehi (113 S 600 E). Free shoes & pizza for the first 20 teens! Bring socks. Look for the lanes with balloons. Families & allies welcome ~ come rent a lane, rent some shoes, hang out & support! We've reserved a couple lanes for our teens, but please, please come and join!

We'll be hanging out and fundraising at Happy Valley Derby Darlins' Roller Derby Monster Bash on October 26th. Join us @ Karl Malone 525 East 200 South Lehi. $7 entrance fee. Juniors race at 6pm and adults race at 7:30pm. Kid friendly partying after until 10pm.
