## What's Happening in November 

- Do you know of some local queer & trans affirming service providers, educators, or spaces? Coaches? Dentists? Job sites? Doctors? Pools? Therapists? Hangout spots? ‚Ä¶ LET US KNOW via our contact page! We‚Äôll check them out and add them to our resource page!

- Support GSAs
Teens are amazing! We partner with local GSAs (gay straight alliances) to provide tangible and emotional support to club members and advisors. Reach out through our Contact page if you want to get involved!

- Educator Pins
Advisors and teachers love having pins in their classroom that they can give to those in the high school who want to display their ally support. We purchase batches of pins to donate, as we receive requests from safe allies on behalf of their spaces. Every $2.50 that you donate (check out our Donate page) gets a pin to a teacher at a high school or other safe space. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
