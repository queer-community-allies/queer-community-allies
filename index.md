## Adopt a GSA
This fall, one of the biggest things you can do to support local teens is reach out to your local high school and ask a counselor or administrator: "How can I contact the school GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) advisor?" A GSA advisor is a teacher, staff member, or counselor who supports the GSA President and often hosts meetings in their/her/his classroom. Get to know the advisor, offer to bring treats once a month, offer to donate some games or craft supplies for their club. Get more [ideas and suggestions](/resources/#Ô∏è-help-for-school-clubs) on our Resources page! #AdoptaGSA

For our clubs -- check out our [projects page](/projects/# -local-gsa-support) to see what we have available right now!
