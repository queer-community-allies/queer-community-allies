## We need help! 

We need 5 more board members! What does a board member do? 

- 1-hour meet every couple months + ongoing virtual contact 
- Volunteer their time, energy, and enthusiasm
- Locals (18+) with a desire to help

Our next meeting is in July! [Email](mailto:contact@queercommunityallies.org) us, contact@queercommunityallies.org, if you're interested in getting an invite. Come see what we're all about! [Learn more](/donate/#volunteer-board-of-directors). 

## Adopt a GSA
This fall, one of the biggest things you can do to support local teens is take action! Reach out to your local high school and ask a counselor or administrator: "How can I contact the school GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) advisor?" A GSA advisor is a teacher, staff member, or counselor who supports the GSA President and often hosts meetings in their/her/his classroom. Get to know the advisor, offer to bring treats once a month, offer to donate some games or craft supplies for their club. Get more [ideas and suggestions](/resources/#Ô∏è-help-for-school-clubs) on our Resources page! #AdoptaGSA
