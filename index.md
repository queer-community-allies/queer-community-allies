## What's Happening in November 

- We have been reaching out to local businesses to ask for gift cards and monetary donations! All donated gift cards will be bundled as a prize; if we receive enough donations, we will do multiple prize bundles. From Monday Nov. 18 to Sun. Dec. 29, 2019, all individuals who donate $10 to Queer Community Allies will be entered into our drawing; individuals may be entered as many times as they wish. ($100 = 10 entries!) The drawing prize will be given to one lucky drawing winner the morning of Dec. 30. All monetary donations from local businesses and from our holiday drawing will be put towards helping GSAs for the rest of the school year, running ongoing support projects, and planning summer community events! *Queer Community Allies is volunteer-led; and board members and volunteers involved in the organization will be ineligible for the prize(s). 

- We support Project Rainbow! Purchase a flag to be put in your yard for Transgender Day of Remembrance and/or sign up to help make, stake, and remove flags. [https://www.projectrainbowutah.org/sign-up](https://www.projectrainbowutah.org/sign-up)

- Do you know of some local queer & trans affirming service providers, educators, or spaces? Coaches? Dentists? Job sites? Doctors? Pools? Therapists? Hangout spots? ‚Ä¶ LET US KNOW via our contact page! We‚Äôll check them out and add them to our resource page!

- Support GSAs ~ 
Teens are amazing! We partner with local GSAs (gay straight alliances) to provide tangible and emotional support to club members and advisors. Reach out through our Contact page if you want to get involved!

- Educator Pins ~ 
Advisors and teachers love having pins in their classroom that they can give to those in the high school who want to display their ally support. We purchase batches of pins to donate, as we receive requests from safe allies on behalf of their spaces. Every $2.50 that you donate (check out our Donate page) gets a pin to a teacher at a high school or other safe space. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
