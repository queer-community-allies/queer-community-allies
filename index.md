## 10 Ways to Be an Ally & a Friend (from GLAAD)  

- Be a listener.
- Be open-minded.
- Be willing to talk.
- Be inclusive.
- Don't assume that your friends and co-workers are straight. Someone close to you could be looking for support in their coming-out process. 
- Anti-LGBT comments and jokes are harmful. Vocalize that you find them offensive.
- Confront your own prejudices and bias, even if it is uncomfortable to do so.
- Defend your LGBT friends against discrimination.
- Believe that all people, regardless of gender identity and sexual orientation, should be treated with dignity and respect.
