## Local GSA Support 

We support GSAs (gay straight alliances/gender sexuality alliances; student-led with a teacher-staff-counselor advisor) in local high schools. Reach out via [email](mailto:contact@queercommunityallies.org) or our social media pages [@QueerCommunityAllies](https://queercommunityallies.org/social/) if you are part of a local GSA looking for help. #AdoptaGSA 

- {Game Library} We loan out games for 2 months at a time. You can reserve them ahead of time. Please take the best care of them you can so we can pass them along to other GSAs after you. * Wizard School * Scooby Doo Clue * Encore * Oregon Trail * Legends of the Hidden Temple (Nickelodeon) * Malarky * Cranium * Cranium Turbo Edition 
- {Button Maker Library} A wonderful community member donated a pin-back button maker! Reach out, send us a design, and we can drop off up to 50 completed buttons * We used to visit schools and let you do the process, but we are stretched thin with volunteers right now. 
- Care package. It will have a mix of snacks, flags, buttons, face masks, or stickers  
- Book bundles from FAM Utah! (high school grade level titles) * If You Could Be Mine (Farizan) * Simon vs The Homosapien Agenda (Albertalli) * Felix Ever After (Callender) * Dreadnought (Daniels) * a rainbow coloring book
- Laminated small signs from SafeSpaceUT. A rainbow-colored circle with text 'You are safe welcome valued heard wanted respected here' on one side and letter from Utah State Board of Education on the other side 'RE: Clarification of Recent Changes to R277-474-3, School Instruction and Human Sexuality, General Provisions.'
- Names of local businesses that we know are affirming who might be interested in sponsoring your GSA on an ongoing basis
- Guest visits from local affirming adults 
- An idea of your own! We've had GSAs request Halloween craft supplies, soda & snacks, and display flags for school events. We want to be here to support YOUR goals, projects, and designs!

## Classroom Decor & Educator Supplies

Teachers often ask us for buttons to distribute to faculty-friends and students and for posters, stickers and flags for their classrooms. If you're a teacher who would like some items, reach out! We'd be happy to gift you some! 

Community ally with a favorite teacher friend? Consider purchasing some swag from our online shop [QueerCommunityAllies at Zazzle.com](https://www.zazzle.com/store/queercommunityallies) as a back-to-school gift. 

Community ally who wants to support? Include a "classroom decor" note with a [donation](https://queercommunityallies.org/donate/) to Queer Community Allies, and we'll make sure that goes to supplies for a great local teacher. 

## Community Events

We love going to Pride, joining other organizations at various city community nights, being involved with other local youth efforts, and hosting events to talk with educators and parents who want to learn more about supporting their queer family members, students, and comunity youth. 

## Community Swag

We love sharing swag from our neighbor organizations! Thank you Pride Center, HRC Utah, Equality Utah, and Encircle for giving us calendars, chapstick, stickers, pamphlets, flags, glow bracelets, and more to distribute to our teens and at local events. We love seeing rainbow swag around town, from any group!

## Dream Project: GSA Meet
 
We started planning a GSA meet for clubs across Utah County to meet, talk, make friends, and share ideas. It was scheduled to happen in April 2020. Due to the spread of COVID-19 and school closures, the event was cancelled. We look forward to this event happening in the future, when it is safe to do so. Regardless, we thank administration at Mountain View for being supportive of hosting the meet, Cravings Alisha's Cupcakes for being willing to give a discount code to anyone who wanted to buy & donate a dozen cupcakes to the event, Flourish Therapy for being willing to donate an activity, and Mama Dragons for being willing to host a booth with info for any parents who wanted to visit!
