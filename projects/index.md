## Local GSA Support 

We support GSAs (gay straight alliances/gender sexuality alliances; student-led with a teacher-staff-counselor advisor) in local high schools, providing tangible and emotional support. Posters, stickers, flags, buttons, masks, wrapped snacks, books, funds for supplies, crafting items, board games, cards, guest visits from affirming adults, contacts from local businesses who can partner for donations... If they don't have the resources for success, we try to help. #AdoptaGSA Reach out through our Contact page if you want to get involved, or if you are part of a local GSA and looking for help. 

## Educator Pins

Advisors and teachers love having pins in their classroom that they can give to those in the high school who want to display their ally support. We purchase batches of pins to donate, as we receive requests from safe allies on behalf of their spaces.
