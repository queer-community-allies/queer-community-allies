## Scrapbook Supplies Drive
We've had a request from GSA teens for scrapbook supplies! They would like to use them to create holiday cards to sell to raise money for their club. If you have supplies you'd like to donate, we will have local drop-off points. More info coming soon! 

## Support GSAs 

Teens are amazing! We partner with local GSAs (gay straight alliances) to provide tangible and emotional support to club members and advisors. Reach out through our Contact page if you want to get involved!

## Educator Pins

Advisors and teachers love having pins in their classroom that they can give to those in the high school who want to display their ally support. We purchase batches of pins to donate, as we receive requests from safe allies on behalf of their spaces. Every $2.50 that you donate (check out our Donate page) gets a pin to a teacher at a high school or other safe space. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

## Community Swag

Queer Community Allies tees are available for $10 each at our community events. We hope to expand our swag collection to include window stickers, water bottles, and more in the near future.
