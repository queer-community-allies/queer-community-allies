## Educator Ally Pins

When we sat down with our first GSA advisor and asked what we could do to help, their immediate response was “Pins for teachers!” They love having a bucket of pins in their classroom that they can make available to teachers in the high school who want to display their ally support. Our first batch was delivered to Westlake High in August 2019. We continue to purchase batches of pins to donate to high schools, as we receive requests from safe allies on behalf of their spaces. Batch delivery dates are dependent on funding. 

Pins have been chosen with a design that represents ally-ship and support. Every $2.50 that you donate gets a pin to a teacher at a high school or other safe space. You’re welcome to purchase a pin for yourself, as well! If so, please email us with the number of pins you purchased for yourself, and we’ll set those aside when they arrive with group batches; pins will be available for pick-up at community events (watch our events page for community gatherings after September 2019). You are also welcome to purchase pins to donate to others, paying-it-forward; just email us with that information. 🏳️‍🌈
