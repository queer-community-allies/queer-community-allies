## Local GSA Support 

We support GSAs (gay straight alliances/gender sexuality alliances; student-led with a teacher-staff-counselor advisor) in local high schools. Reach out via [email](mailto:contact@queercommunityallies.org) or our social media pages [@QueerCommunityAllies](https://queercommunityallies.org/social/) if you are part of a local GSA looking for help. #AdoptaGSA

## Classroom Decor & Educator Supplies

Teachers ask us for buttons to have available for faculty, friends and students and ask for posters, stickers and flags for their classrooms. If you're a teacher who would like some items, reach out! We'd be happy to gift you some! 

Community ally with a favorite teacher friend? Consider purchasing some swag from our online shop [QueerCommunityAllies at Zazzle.com](https://www.zazzle.com/store/queercommunityallies) as a back-to-school gift. 

Community ally who wants to support? Include a "classroom decor" note with a [donation](https://queercommunityallies.org/donate/) to Queer Community Allies, and we'll make sure that goes to supplies for a great local teacher. 

## Community Events

We love going to Pride, joining other organizations at various city community nights, being involved with other local youth efforts, and hosting events to talk with educators and parents who want to learn more about supporting their queer family members, students, and comunity youth. 

## Community Swag

We love sharing swag from our neighbor organizations! Thank you Pride Center, HRC Utah, Equality Utah, and Encircle for giving us calendars, chapstick, stickers, pamphlets, flags, glow bracelets, and more to distribute to our teens and at local events. We love seeing rainbow swag around town!

## GSA Meets

Timpview GSA teen leaders organized and hosted an inter-GSA meet in spring 2021! They did an amazing job! We were so happy to support by providing dinner for everyone there. 

Queer Community Allies began planning an inter-GSA event in spring 2020 for local teens to meet, make new friends, and collaborate. Due to the spread of COVID-19 and school closures, the event was cancelled. We thank administration at Mountain View for being supportive of hosting, Cravings Alisha's Cupcakes for offering donation discount codes, Flourish Therapy for offering an activity, and Mama Dragons for being willing to provide a parent booth. 

We are committed to supporting inter-GSA networking and socializing. It's our goal to always have funding to help these events along.
