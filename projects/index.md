## Local GSA Support 

We help GSAs (gay straight alliances/gender sexuality alliances; student-led with a teacher-staff-counselor advisor) in local high schools, providing tangible and emotional support. Posters, stickers, flags, buttons, masks, wrapped snacks, books, funds for supplies, crafting items, board games, cards, guest visits from affirming adults, contacts from local businesses who can partner for donations... If they don't have the resources for success, we try to help. Reach out through our Contact page if you want to get involved, or if you are part of a local GSA looking for help. #AdoptaGSA 

## Classroom Decor & Educator Buttons

Teachers often ask us for buttons to distribute to faculty-friends and students and for posters, stickers and flags for their classrooms. If you're a teacher who would like some items, reach out! We'd be happy to gift you some! 

Community ally with a favorite teacher friend? Consider purchasing some swag from our online shop [QueerCommunityAllies at Zazzle.com](https://www.zazzle.com/store/queercommunityallies) as a back-to-school gift. 

Community ally who wants to support? Include a "classroom decor" note with a [donation](https://queercommunityallies.org/donate/) to Queer Community Allies, and we'll make sure that goes to supplies for a great local teacher. 

## Community Events

We've been to one Pride (yay Provo 2019!) and look forward to more! We also love joining other organizations at various city community nights, being involved with other local youth efforts like Communities That Care, and talking with educators and parents who want to learn more about supporting their queer family members, students, and neighbors. 

## Community Swag

We love sharing swag from our neighbor organizations! Thank you Pride Center, Equality Utah, and Encircle for giving us calendars, chapstick, stickers, pamphlets, flags, glow bracelets, and more to distribute to our teens and at local events. We love seeing rainbow swag around town, from any group!

## Dream Project: GSA Meet
 
We started planning a GSA meet for clubs across Utah County to meet, talk, make friends, and share ideas. It was scheduled to happen in April 2020. Due to the spread of COVID-19 and school closures, the event was cancelled. We look forward to this event happening in the future, when it is safe to do so. Regardless, we thank administration at Mountain View for being supportive of hosting the meet, Cravings Alisha's Cupcakes for being willing to give a discount code to anyone who wanted to buy & donate a dozen cupcakes to the event, Flourish Therapy for being willing to donate an activity, and Mama Dragons for being willing to host a booth with info for any parents who wanted to visit!
