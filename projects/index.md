## Local GSA Support 

We support GSAs (gay straight alliances/gender sexuality alliances; student-led with a teacher-staff-counselor advisor) in local high schools. Posters, stickers, flags, buttons, masks, wrapped snacks, books, funds for supplies, crafting items, board games, cards, guest visits from affirming adults, contacts from local businesses who can partner for donations... If they don't have the resources for success, we try to help. Reach out via [email](mailto:contact@queercommunityallies.org) or our social media pages [@QueerCommunityAllies](https://queercommunityallies.org/social/) if you want to get involved, or if you are part of a local GSA looking for help. #AdoptaGSA 

To GSA student leaders and advisors, message us if you'd like any of the following!

- {Game Library} We loan out games for 2 months at a time. You can reserve them ahead of time. Please take the best care of them you can so we can pass them along to other GSAs after you. 
- {Button Maker Library} A wonderful community member donated a pin-back button maker! We are available to bring it by to a meeting with ~50 blank buttons (about an hour of use). 
- Care package. It will have a mix of swag, snacks, flags, or stickers. Right now we have special book bags from FAM Utah! Book bundles include: If You Could Be Mine (Farizan), Simon vs The Homosapien Agenda (Albertalli), Felix Ever After (Callender), Dreadnought (Daniels). We also have ONE coloring book. 
- Laminated small signs from SafeSpaceUT. A rainbow-colored circle with text 'You are safe welcome valued heard wanted respected here' on one side and letter from Utah State Board of Education on the other side 'RE: Clarification of Recent Changes to R277-474-3, School Instruction and Human Sexuality, General Provisions.'
- An idea of your own! We've had GSAs request Halloween craft supplies, soda & snacks, and display items for school events. We want to be here to support YOUR goals, projects, and dreams!

## Classroom Decor & Educator Supplies

Teachers often ask us for buttons to distribute to faculty-friends and students and for posters, stickers and flags for their classrooms. If you're a teacher who would like some items, reach out! We'd be happy to gift you some! 

Community ally with a favorite teacher friend? Consider purchasing some swag from our online shop [QueerCommunityAllies at Zazzle.com](https://www.zazzle.com/store/queercommunityallies) as a back-to-school gift. 

Community ally who wants to support? Include a "classroom decor" note with a [donation](https://queercommunityallies.org/donate/) to Queer Community Allies, and we'll make sure that goes to supplies for a great local teacher. 

## Community Events

We love going to Pride, joining other organizations at various city community nights, being involved with other local youth efforts, and hosting events to talk with educators and parents who want to learn more about supporting their queer family members, students, and comunity youth. 

## Community Swag

We love sharing swag from our neighbor organizations! Thank you Pride Center, HRC Utah, Equality Utah, and Encircle for giving us calendars, chapstick, stickers, pamphlets, flags, glow bracelets, and more to distribute to our teens and at local events. We love seeing rainbow swag around town, from any group! Check out our Queer Community Allies swag collection at [QueerCommunityAllies at Zazzle.com](https://www.zazzle.com/store/queercommunityallies).

## Dream Project: GSA Meet
 
We started planning a GSA meet for clubs across Utah County to meet, talk, make friends, and share ideas. It was scheduled to happen in April 2020. Due to the spread of COVID-19 and school closures, the event was cancelled. We look forward to this event happening in the future, when it is safe to do so. Regardless, we thank administration at Mountain View for being supportive of hosting the meet, Cravings Alisha's Cupcakes for being willing to give a discount code to anyone who wanted to buy & donate a dozen cupcakes to the event, Flourish Therapy for being willing to donate an activity, and Mama Dragons for being willing to host a booth with info for any parents who wanted to visit!
