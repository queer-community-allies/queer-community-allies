## Educator Ally Pins

When we sat down with our first GSA advisor and asked what we could do to help, their immediate response was “Pins for teachers!” They love having a bucket of pins in their classroom that they can make available to teachers in the high school who want to display their ally support. We now routinely purchase batches of pins to have on-hand for these educators. 

Pins have been chosen with a design that represents ally-ship and support. Every $2.50 that you donate gets a pin to a teacher at a high school or other safe space. You’re welcome to purchase a pin for yourself, as well! Just email us with the number of pins you purchased for yourself, and we’ll set those aside when they arrive. Pins will be available for pick-up at community events as they are held. You are also welcome to purchase pins to donate to others, paying-it-forward; just email us with that information. 🏳️‍🌈
