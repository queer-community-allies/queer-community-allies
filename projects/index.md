When we sat down with our first GSA advisor and asked what we could do to help, their first response was “Pins for teachers!” They would love to have a bucket of pins in their classroom that they can make available to teachers in the high school who want to display their ally support. 

Pins have been chosen with a design that represents ally-ship and support. Every $2.50 that you donate gets a pin to a teacher at the high school. You’re welcome to purchase a pin for yourself, as well! Just email us (see our contact page) with the number of pins you purchased for yourself, and we’ll set those aside when they arrive. Pins will be available for pick-up at our opening social event (see our events page) and at community events thereafter. You are also welcome to purchase pins to donate to others, paying-it-forward; just email us with that information.
