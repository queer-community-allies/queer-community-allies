## GSAs (Gay Straight Alliances)

We love teens! They are bright, focused, fun, and our future! We partner with local GSAs to provide tangible and emotional support to club members and advisors. Reach out through our contact page if you want to get involved!

## Educator Ally Pins

When we sat down with our first GSA advisor and asked what we could do to help, their immediate response was ‚ÄúPins for teachers!‚Äù They love having a bucket of pins in their classroom that they can make available to teachers in the high school who want to display their ally support. Our first batch was delivered to Westlake High in August 2019. We continue to purchase batches of pins to donate to high schools, as we receive requests from safe allies on behalf of their spaces. Batch delivery dates are dependent on funding. 

Pins have been chosen with a design that represents ally-ship and support. Every $2.50 that you donate gets a pin to a teacher at a high school or other safe space. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

## Community Swag

Queer Community Allies tees are available for $10 each at our community events. We hope to expand our swag collection to include window stickers, water bottles, and more in the near future.
