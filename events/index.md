Queer Community Allies is a mobile support system (and we don't get enough funds yet to have a physical space), so we only occasionally host events. If you want to be involved and help plan events, AND know of a free or inexpensive place to host them, please reach out and let us know! We're always looking for volunteers who can invest multiple hours each month to help run on-going projects.
