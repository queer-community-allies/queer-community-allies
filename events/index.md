![this month's calendar](/files/calOct.pdf) 

We hope everyone had fun at the Monarchs game in June! Equality Utah, Utah Pride Center, FAM Utah, Queer Community Allies and the Real Monarchs partnered to honor students and teachers working towards more inclusive schools!

Follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/queercommunityallies/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QueerCommunityAllies), @QueerCommunityAllies, where we link to lots of virtual events, and check out our photos from fun past events! (Kickoff picnic, chilling at Provo Pride, fall break bowling, hanging out at roller derby, art night, end-of-school swag tables...)

Queer Community Allies is a mobile support system (and we don't get enough funds yet to have a physical space), so we only occasionally host events. If you want to be involved and help plan events, AND know of a free or inexpensive place to host them, please reach out and [let us know](/donate/#volunteer-board-of-directors)! We're always looking for volunteers who can invest multiple hours each month to help run on-going projects.
