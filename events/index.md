- **Our 1st Birthday!** (Date TBD in July or August) will be an evening @ 6-8pm. Join us for a casual outdoor gathering for families, friends, teens & allies to celebrate ONE YEAR of our organization! Will likely be held at a park to allow for safe social distancing, and masks will be strongly encouraged. More details to come! Follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/queercommunityallies/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QueerCommunityAllies) for updates.  


Check out our Instagram & Facebook pages for photos from fun past events! (Kickoff picnic, chilling at Provo Pride, fall break bowling, hanging out at roller derby, art night...)


Queer Community Allies is a mobile support system (and we don't get enough funds yet to have a physical space), so we only occasionally host events. If you want to be involved and help plan events, AND know of a free or inexpensive place to host them, please reach out and let us know! We're always looking for volunteers who can invest multiple hours each month to help run on-going projects.
