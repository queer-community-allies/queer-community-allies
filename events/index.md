[Utah Pride Center PRIDE June 1-7](https://utahpridecenter.org/pride-and-center/pride-week-2021/) and more [events](https://utahpridecenter.org/pride-and-center/)! 

![this month's calendar](/files/calJune.jpg) 

Follow us on Instagram [@QueerCommunityAllies](https://www.instagram.com/queercommunityallies/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QueerCommunityAllies) where we link to lots of virtual events! 

Check out our Instagram & Facebook pages for photos from fun past events! (Kickoff picnic, chilling at Provo Pride, fall break bowling, hanging out at roller derby, art night, end-of-school swag tables...)

Queer Community Allies is a mobile support system (and we don't get enough funds yet to have a physical space), so we only occasionally host events. If you want to be involved and help plan events, AND know of a free or inexpensive place to host them, please reach out and [let us know](/how-to-help)! We're always looking for volunteers who can invest multiple hours each month to help run on-going projects.
