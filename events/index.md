We hope everyone had fun at the Monarchs game in June! Equality Utah, Utah Pride Center, FAM Utah, Queer Community Allies and the Real Monarchs partnered to honor students and teachers working towards more inclusive schools!

Follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/queercommunityallies/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QueerCommunityAllies), @QueerCommunityAllies, where we share links to upcoming local events. 

Queer Community Allies is a small, mobile support system. If you want to be involved and help plan events, AND know of a free or inexpensive place to host them, please reach out and [let us know](/donate/#volunteer-board-of-directors)! We're always looking for volunteers who can invest multiple hours each month to help run on-going projects. Examples of past QCA events: kickoff picnic, attending Provo Pride, bowling, hanging out at roller derby, art night, end of school year swag visits.
