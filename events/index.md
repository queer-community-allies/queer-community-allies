## Save the date! 

Saturday August 10th will be our kickoff event, an opening social and fundraiser! It will be a casual outdoor evening, potluck style, with a playground for the kids, dinner options available for purchase, and t-shirts available for purchase with our name and rubber bands and rainbow tie-dye available to personalize them with rainbow colors. All proceeds will go towards funding our fall projects with local teens. We look forward to interacting with our community, meeting new friends, and introducing ourselves! 

- Gender neutral restrooms are not available. There will be gendered stall restrooms at the park. 
- There are drinking fountains at the park. 
- The park is dog-friendly.
