Follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/queercommunityallies/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QueerCommunityAllies), @QueerCommunityAllies, where we share links to upcoming local events. 

Queer Community Allies is a small, mobile support system. If you want to be involved and help plan events, AND know of a free or inexpensive place to host them, please reach out and [let us know](/donate/#volunteer-board-of-directors)! 

We're always looking for volunteers who can invest multiple hours each month to help run on-going projects. Examples of past QCA events: kickoff picnic, attending Provo Pride, bowling, hanging out at roller derby, art night, end of school year swag visits, Monarchs Pride night (June 2021) and game.
