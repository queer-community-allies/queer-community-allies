## üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà For Teachers
We get asked all the time, "How can I make my classroom/space more LGBTQ friendly?" and "What resources do I have as a teacher?" 
- Idea: Introduce yourself with your pronouns to your students and coworkers.
- Idea: Put just one rainbow sticker somewhere in your space, or wear a rainbow pin on your lanyard.
- There are lots of ways to show allyship! Find something that feels true to you.
